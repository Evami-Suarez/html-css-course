- every element have their own attributes
- attributes modifiest how the element behaves
- In html extra spaces are ignored
- rgb in css is how much red, green and blue in our color, 
- 255 is the maximum value of rgb
- rgb(255.255.255) white
- rgb(0.0.0) black
- psuedo-class add extrastyles to the element in certain situation
- hex is another way to measure color eg. #f25d6g first 2 digit is how much red, 3rd and 4th tells us how much green and the last 2 is how much blue
- height and width forces the element to have that measurement so its not a good idea, padding is the good idea
